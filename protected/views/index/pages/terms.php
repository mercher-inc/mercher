<h2>
    About Mercher
</h2>

<p>
    Mercher is a platform that allows users to offer, sell and buy products and services. As a platform, Mercher does
    not own or sell the items or services listed on this website, so the actual contract for sale is directly between
    the sellers and buyers.
</p>

<p>
    While we may provide pricing, shipping, and other guidance in our services, such guidance is solely
    informational and you may choose not to follow it. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes
    through various means, Mercher has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or
    legality of items or services advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of
    sellers to sell items or services; the ability of buyers to pay for items or services; or that a buyer or seller
    will actually complete a transaction or return an item.
</p>

<h2>
    Abusing Mercher
</h2>

<p>
    Without limiting other remedies, we may, limit, suspend, or terminate our services and user accounts, restrict
    or prohibit access to, and your activities on, our services, delay or remove hosted content, remove any special
    status associated with the account, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and legal steps to
    keep you from using our services if:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        we think that you are creating problems or possible legal liabilities;
    </li>
    <li>
        we think that such restrictions will improve the security of the Mercher community or reduce our or another
        Mercher user's exposure to financial liabilities
    </li>
    <li>
        we think that you are infringing the rights of third parties; broadly, we prohibit anything that is
        derogatory to somebody else; anything that you didn't create; or anything that is illegal.
    </li>
    <li>
        we think that you are acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement or our policies;
    </li>
    <li>
        we believe you attempt to modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reduce or attempt
        to reduce to a human perceivable form any of the software provided by Mercher or used by Mercher in
        providing the service.
    </li>
    <li>
        despite our reasonable endeavors, we are unable to verify or authenticate information you provide to us.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When a buyer or seller issue arises we may consider the user's performance history and the specific
    circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement and to do the
    right thing for both buyers and sellers. Bottom line: try to do good business both as a seller and a buyer and
    we’ll do our best to support you.
</p>

<h2>
    If You Are a Buyer
</h2>

<p>
    When buying an item, you agree that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a commitment to buy;
    </li>
    <li>
        You enter into a legally binding contract specifically with the seller to purchase an item when you commit to
        buy an item;
    </li>
    <li>
        You will pay attention to the details of the transaction, because your total price may include taxes, fees, and
        shipping costs, all of which you are responsible for funding;
    </li>
    <li>
        For motor vehicles and real estate, an offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious
        expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and
        the seller;
    </li>
    <li>
        We do not transfer legal ownership of items or services from the seller to the buyer;
    </li>
    <li>
        All actual payments are made with PayPal&trade; services, therefore all PayPal&trade; Terms and Conditions are
        applicable;
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    If You are a Seller
</h2>

<p>
    When listing an item, you agree that you are responsible for the accuracy and content, and quantity of the listing
    and item offered.
</p>

<p>
    To run a great business, sellers work hard to ensure smooth and professional transactions with their buyers. This
    includes setting buyer expectations and meeting those expectations. Some of the most basic things you can do as a
    seller are to provide accurate and consistent details about your item and to be clear and specific about the terms
    and conditions of the sale, including any applicable taxes. You should also make every effort to provide excellent
    customer service from start to finish, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Charging reasonable shipping and handling costs and whether you are willing to ship internationally;
    </li>
    <li>
        Specifying your handling time and return policy in your listing;
    </li>
    <li>
        Responding to buyers' questions promptly;
    </li>
    <li>
        Being professional throughout the transaction;
    </li>
    <li>
        Making sure the item is delivered to the buyer as described in your listing;
    </li>
    <li>
        Frequently reviewing and updating listings to make sure all information – such as inventory status and item
        condition – is accurate and up to date;
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    For Buyers and Sellers
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        You understand that your content is public. It can and will be seen by any user on public social networks and
        any external links to your item;
    </li>
    <li>
        Mercher does not take responsibility for any of the information provided by the seller, does not handle any
        payment processing, and takes no responsibility on transaction details;
    </li>
    <li>
        You retain all rights to any content you submit for upload and use in Mercher. You agree that you own or have
        use rights to use all content you reference or post in Mercher. In addition, you agree to the following: When
        you post content, you are committing that the content really, truly belongs only to you and that the posting and
        use of your content does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights,
        intellectual property rights, or human rights of any other person or entity. We are not responsible if the
        content is not really yours or if you infringe on others' rights; you will be responsible if there are any costs
        associated with ownership and rights issues;
    </li>
    <li>
        If you terminate your application subscription, your content from the website will not be used outside of the
        website anymore, but we might still have it stored in backup files or on servers for any legal reason;
    </li>
    <li>
        If you stop using the Mercher application your Content will remain in our website, unless you actively remove
        your content;
    </li>
    <li>
        You agree that you will follow all use and ownership terms in Facebook’s&reg; Statement of Rights and
        Responsibilities. These change periodically and you should review them regularly.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    About the Transaction
</h2>

<h3>
    Returns
</h3>

<p>
    You're required to specify your return policy in your listings, even if you don't accept returns.
</p>

<p>
    If you accept returns, buyers can return an item for any reason, including when they change their mind about a
    purchase &ndash; as long as the return meets the return requirements &ndash; for example, returning an item within
    your stated time frame, and meeting item condition requirements.
</p>

<p>
    We encourage you to accept returns &ndash; it helps increase buyer satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
    If you accept returns, you must specify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The time period in which a buyer must notify you about a return;
    </li>
    <li>
        The restocking fee, if any;
    </li>
    <li>
        Who pays for return shipping;
    </li>
    <li>
        If there are item conditions required for return, and clearly state those conditions;
    </li>
    <li>
        How the refund is issued.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Disputes
</h3>

<p>
    Given Mercher is not involved in the contractual sale between buyer and seller, Mercher is not an arbitrator in any
    potential conflict resolution. Any disputes should be resolved using the PayPal&trade; Resolution Process, as PayPal&trade;
    is the primary mechanism for sale consummation on Mercher. Mercher team may make inquiries and may conduct an
    investigation into disputes, if alerted, but does not have capacity to be the final arbitrator of disputes. Repeat
    offenses from users will be noted and Mercher could take actions to suspend their accounts. Otherwise, we recommend
    taking typical internet commerce precautionary measures, including dealing locally and reviewing seller/buyer
    history.
</p>

<h3>
    Feedback
</h3>

<p>
    Feedback is important to maintain the flow of good commerce. Mercher provides no forum or assurance as to the
    integrity or credibility of buyers and sellers. Both parties are advised to give and receive feedback via tools
    provided by Facebook&reg; and PayPal&trade; services, adhering to their respective terms of service.
</p>

<p>
    When you use the Mercher service to pay for items or services, you agree that we may communicate with you
    electronically regarding any important information about your purchases or your account.
</p>
